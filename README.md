# **House Price Prediction**
Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting
## Description

The Training and Testing data are from the Kaggle Competition for House Prices Prediction using advanced regression techniques.

The Competition Description is to ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence

In this project I used Linear Regression with NumPy only and also used the Linear Regression built in sklearn library and used the Mean Absolute Error to detect the accuracy of the program.

## Run Code

You can use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to run the file and see the data and the results
